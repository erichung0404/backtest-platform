Description: Automates many of the tasks associated with quantitative
        discourse analysis of transcripts containing discourse
        including frequency counts of sentence types, words, sentences,
        turns of talk, syllables and other assorted analysis tasks. The
        package provides parsing tools for preparing transcript data.
        Many functions enable the user to aggregate data by any number
        of grouping variables, providing analysis and seamless
        integration with other R packages that undertake higher level
        analysis and visualization of text.  This affords the user a
        more efficient and targeted analysis.  'qdap' is designed for
        transcript analysis, however, many functions are applicable to
        other areas of Text Mining/Natural Language Processing.
